              <p class="bio">
                My background prior to Pursuit is in customer service and office
                administration, where I have proven myself to be a loyal and
                contentious employee at several top tier organizations. It was
                during this time, that I refined my communication skills,
                mastering the ability communicate clearly and concisely. As well
                as proving myself to be able to navigate and communicate
                diplomatically across various levels of an organization. I am
                grateful for my opportunity at Pursuit as it allows me the
                opportunity to gain the skills necessary to bring my customer
                service experience to the fast-growing tech field and hopefully
                become a champion for diversity in the industry. My goal is be
                able to build impactful and beautiful client interfaces that
                convert customers into clients.In my spare time, you can find me
                playing my oboe, and exploring the sights of New York City.

                Hello, I go by Josh. I am an experienced professional with a
                diverse background in project management and business
                intelligence. I am currently working to further develop my
                software development/engineering skills, and applying those
                skills to big data projects that would help improve my community
                and green initiatives. I am passionate about consumer rights,
                machine learning, privacy and ethical implementation of
                algorithms. My hobbies include birdwatching, mushroom foraging,
                exploring nature, soccer and basketball.

                I have been teaching for five years now and am ready to take the
                skills that I have learned in Education to a new career in
                Technology. As a teacher I have learned the art of patience, the
                need to be flexible and the importance of creativity. My
                students make up such a large portion of my world that it is
                hard to imagine a world that doesn’t include them—I am embarking
                on this new journey so that I can show them that there are other
                career options available and the path most taken isn’t the only
                path.
